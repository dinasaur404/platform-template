- if there isn't a .env, then wrangler types doesn't figure it out
  - maybe we should read from .env.example as well?
- all these vars and secrets, bleh
  - how do you do optional vars and make it work with typegen?
  - should we have a platforms binding?
  - should we be able to use the oauth token from inside a worker for local dev
- need type safety with db/query builder
